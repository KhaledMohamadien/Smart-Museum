# Smart-Museum

The Main Idea of the project is introducing the feature of optoelectronics in smart museums when the solar panel exposed to the white leds lights the speaker begins to explain the arts in the picture so that the audience could hear the description of the arts at the museum from speakers without the need of someone to read the descriptions and explain them.

Smart Museum Project consists of two main arduino hardware parts : Transmitter and Receiver 

In this tutorial we will learn how to play audio files with the Arduino. For this we will use speaker. Also we will use SD card module for keep the audio files. </br></br>
